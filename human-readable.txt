React Employee App

Step 1: Design the User Interface
    (a)Sketch the Layout:
        Create wireframes for the main components: Employee List, Add/Edit Employee Form, Search Bar, and Navigation.
        Style the Application:
    (b)Use CSS to define a consistent color scheme and typography.

Step 2: Create the Main Components
    (a)Header Component:
        Create a header component to display the application title and navigation links if needed.
    (b)EmployeeList Component:
        Create a component to display a list of employees with basic details and buttons for editing and deleting each employee.
    (c)EmployeeForm Component:
        Create a form component for adding and editing employee details. Include fields for name, surname, email, position, department, phone, image URL, and start date.
    (d)SearchBar Component:
        Create a search bar component to filter employees by name, surname, ID number, department, and duration at the organization.
    (e)Notification Component:
        Create a component to display notifications for actions like adding, updating, or deleting employees.
    
Step 3: Implement State Management
    (a)Set Up State:
        Use React's useState hook to manage state for employees, the selected employee, and notifications.
    (b)CRUD Operations:
        Implement functions to add, update, and delete employees. Ensure these operations update the state and local storage.
    (c)Search Functionality:
        Implement a function to filter employees based on search criteria.

Step 4: Handle Persistence with Local Storage
    (a)Save to Local Storage:
        Implement logic to save the employees array to local storage whenever it is updated.
    (b)Load from Local Storage:
        Implement logic to load the employees array from local storage when the application initializes.

Step 5: Ensure Responsiveness
    (a)Media Queries:
        Use custom CSS media queries to ensure the application is responsive across different breakpoints (320px, 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1200px).
    (b)Test Responsiveness:
        Test the application on various devices and screen sizes to ensure it looks good and works well everywhere.

Step 6: Add Interactivity
    (a)Hover Effects:
        Implement hover effects for clickable elements to improve user interactivity.
    (b)Cursor Changes:
        Change the cursor style for clickable elements to indicate interactivity.
Step 7: Testing and Debugging
    (a)Unit Testing:
        Write unit tests for critical functions and components using a testing library like Jest.
    (b)Debugging:
        Debug any issues that arise and ensure the application runs smoothly without errors.
